Revision history for Perl extension JavaScript::Minifier::XS.

0.03        Wed May 28, 14:46 PDT 2008
    - fix minification when a regexp follows a comment that ends with something
      that looks like code; was treating it as division instead of as a literal
    - properly clear end of internally allocated buffers
    - added some debugging output, which could be enabled at compile-time
