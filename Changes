Revision history for Perl extension JavaScript::Minifier::XS.

0.15      2021-10-15 20:21:23-07:00 America/Vancouver
    - GH#8 - preserve newlines when collapsing whitespace; if a block of
      whitespace contains a newline, then when collapsing we collapse to a
      newline character, not just "the first whitespace char we found"

0.14      2021-02-06 23:36:36-08:00 America/Vancouver
    - rewrote test suite into a single ".t" test
    - optimized memory allocations, by allocating Nodes in bulk, and being
      smarter about when we need to free/reallocate content buffers in Nodes
    - optimize whitespace collapsing
    - GH#3 / RT#108682; fix whitespace reduction at end of preserved line
      comment.  Thanks to Dan Goodliffe
    - GH#6; fix unescaped slash in character set, inside of a regex, with thanks
      to @faf

    - RT #58416; don't segfault when trying to minify non-javascript

0.10        Mon Jan 26 22:46 PST 2015
    - RT #64948; allow builds on older versions of Perl.
      Thanks to Michael Robinton and Ruslan Zakirov.
    - Lowered minimum Perl version to v5.6.0, as detected by
      Perl::MinimumVersion.
    - RT #51008; allow for minification of JS code that returns regexps from
      functions.
      Thanks to James Barton, Robert Krimen, and Randy Stauner.
    - Added "xt/test-compile.t" to test minification against a wider range of
      JS.  While not a 100% guarantee that the JS still works, it does provide
      a wider range of JS to test against.

      (similar behaviour as described for CSS::Minifier::XS in RT #36557)

0.04        Wed May 28, 21:58 PDT 2008
    - rebuild packages; wrong version number in META.yml

0.03        Wed May 28, 14:46 PDT 2008
    - fix minification when a regexp follows a comment that ends with something
      that looks like code; was treating it as division instead of as a literal
    - properly clear end of internally allocated buffers
    - added some debugging output, which could be enabled at compile-time

0.02        Tue May  6 00:16 PDT 2008
