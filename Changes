Revision history for Perl extension JavaScript::Minifier::XS.

    - RT #58416; don't segfault when trying to minify non-javascript

0.10        Mon Jan 26 22:46 PST 2015
    - RT #64948; allow builds on older versions of Perl.
      Thanks to Michael Robinton and Ruslan Zakirov.
    - Lowered minimum Perl version to v5.6.0, as detected by
      Perl::MinimumVersion.
    - RT #51008; allow for minification of JS code that returns regexps from
      functions.
      Thanks to James Barton, Robert Krimen, and Randy Stauner.
    - Added "xt/test-compile.t" to test minification against a wider range of
      JS.  While not a 100% guarantee that the JS still works, it does provide
      a wider range of JS to test against.

    - rebuild packages; wrong version number in META.yml

0.03        Wed May 28, 14:46 PDT 2008
    - fix minification when a regexp follows a comment that ends with something
      that looks like code; was treating it as division instead of as a literal
    - properly clear end of internally allocated buffers
    - added some debugging output, which could be enabled at compile-time
